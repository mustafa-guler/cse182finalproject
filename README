Run the setup bash script to install dependencies and fix some system dependent code.
It requires the path to the hmmer binaries.
    Example: ./setup ~/hmmer-3.1b2-linux-intel-x86_64/bin
You will need root access. Some commands may not translate well to os x. 

It will install packages:
    fastxpy with pip
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fastxpy/
    selenium with pip
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium
    Moose with cpan
        http://search.cpan.org/~ether/Moose-2.2005/lib/Moose.pm

These are necessary for the code to work, if you do not want these packages don't run the setup script.


Install the pfamscan tool under the Pfam directory (whole folder from ftp)
    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/Tools/

Install the hmmer tools as a requirement for Pfam:
    http://hmmer.org/download.html

Also, install the phantomjs driver into the Prints folder from here:
    http://phantomjs.org/download.html



Sources of Tools (This project's purpose is education only):

Pfam/PfamScan/

    ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/prosite/ps_scan/

prosite.dat in Databases directory can be found:

Besides fastxpy I did not write any of these tools and make no claim on them.
